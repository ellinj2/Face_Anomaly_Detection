## Anomaly Detection in Face Images

This project hosts the code for implementing the ADIFI pipeline architecture for face anomaly detection in images as presented in our project for CSCI6962 Projects for ML and AI.

The full paper will be available upon release.

## Highlights
- **Object Detection** performed by [**FCOS**](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/FCOS/)
- **Anomaly Detection** using a deep two-class convolutional network and heuristic distribution transformation
- **Labeled Image Generation** with negative-log-likelihood scores displayed in bounding boxes
